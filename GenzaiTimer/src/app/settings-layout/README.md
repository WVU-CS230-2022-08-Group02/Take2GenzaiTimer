# Settings

## Description

The settings page allows the user to modify the duration of the timer periods. The user has control over the duration of their work,
short break, long break, and the interval at which they take long breaks. When each user is created they receive the default
settings; work for 25 minutes, short break for 5 minutes, long break for 15 minutes and after three short breaks have passed a 15 minute long break is taken.
If a user logs in they're settings are automatically used for the timer and if no user is signed in the default settings are used. 

## How to Use

To use the settings page the user simply needs to enter their desired values into the given fields. For example if the user inputted 20 in the field labeled work then the work timer would start at 20 minutes. All fields must have entered values from 0 to 59.
