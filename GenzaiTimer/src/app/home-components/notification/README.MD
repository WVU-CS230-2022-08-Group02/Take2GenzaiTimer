Notification: Readme 

Studying can be long and stressful; sometimes we could use a source of positive motivation. This is where the notification component comes in handy. 

Once on the website, this component sends a desktop notification in a consistent interval of 5 minutes. Every 5 minutes it chooses from a list of motivation messages stored in a list in the typescript file. It will choose a random one and send the notification to the user in the bottom right hand corner. 

The notifciation stays on the screen for 5 seconds and then gradually fades off.
